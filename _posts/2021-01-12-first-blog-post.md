Hi readers, this will be my first blog post on this website.

My hope is that this website will be a portfolio for any potential recruiters/employers as well as a blog that will keep track of my interests such as gaming, learning code, travel and food.

Some ideas I have for this website:
- Coding diary to keep track of things I've learnt and hope to learn.
- Watch list to keep track of shows I'm watching and maybe to give a review of.
- Travel blog
- Food blog

Thanks for reading.
